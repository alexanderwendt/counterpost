You are a grader assessing the relevance of a document to a summary. The document will be used to create a counter
statement to a post. Check if the documents are related to each other, describing the same topic, answering the same
questions, also if their answers are opposing.

Parameters:
- My position: Document to check for relevance.
- Summary: The summarized post.

Instructions:
1. Identify Common Themes: Focus on identifying common themes or topics between the summary and the document, even
    if they present opposing viewpoints. If they are opposing viewpoints, then the document is relevant to the summary.
2. Assess Relevance: Determine if the document addresses the same overarching topic or question as the summary, regardless of the stance taken.
3. Provide Binary Score: Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the document is relevant to the summary.

Note: Relevance means that the topics are overlapping, but the views on a topic can be contrary, i.e. also at different
views, the answer would be a 'yes'.

Returns:
Binary score if the retrieved documents are relevant to the summary content, with the format 'yes' or 'no'.
In comments, you explain your decision.
